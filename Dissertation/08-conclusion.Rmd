# Discussion

\TeX{} and its extensions have more functionality than could realistically be added to R but by targeting the most useful features of \TeX{}, as `dvir` did originally and as has been continued in this project, many use cases are accommodated. The changes discussed in this report have made the `dvir` package better especially for displaying text and equations, graphics with many `grid.latex()` calls, or even when developing graphics with `grid.latex()` which requires rerunning code with small tweaks to get the perfect graphic.
