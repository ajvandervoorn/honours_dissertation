# Code speed (part 1) - removing redundant font sweeps

In the introduction of this report the case for the `dvir` package was motivated with a simple example of a mathematical equation. The `dvir` package can be used on a larger scale too.

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}

The example in figure \@ref(fig:yeeExample) was created by a University of Auckland lecturer using the `dvir` package to help write an assignment.

One of the first things investigated in the package was the speed of running the code. Anecdotally, generating any R graphic with non-trivial \TeX{}, like that in figure \@ref(fig:yeeExample), took a long time so it was desirable to speed it up.

To look into this the first task was to profile the existing code to let us see where in the package time was being spent. This was in `dvir` version 0.2-1. The profiling results were visualised with `profvis::profvis()`.

```{r prof1, fig.cap = "Screenshot of \\texttt{profvis::profvis()} output for the simple example in \\texttt{dvir} version 0.2-1.", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("../Figures/profilingSimpleProfvis_0.2-1.PNG")
```

We can see the function call stack in figure \@ref(fig:prof1). At the bottom is the call to `grid.latex()`, which immediately calls `grid.draw()` which in turn calls `latexGrob()`. This calls `readDVI()` for about the first 20ms, then `dviGrob()` for the remaining time to the end of the original `grid.latex()` function call, and so on up the function call stack.

```{r prof2, fig.cap = "Screenshot of \\texttt{profvis::profvis()} output for the code creating the example at the start of this section, highlighting the time spent in \\texttt{engine\\$fontDef}.", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("../Figures/profilingYeeProfvis_0.2-1_highlight.PNG")
```

The `profvis::profvis()` output for our more complicated example, in figure \@ref(fig:prof2) reveals most of the time to create the figure is in `grid.latex()`. Note that the code to draw the arrows and the "(a)" in this example is so quick it occupies the very skinny call stack on the far left of the graph. `grid.latex()` and its subsequent function calls, on the other hand, take up most of the time required to produce the example.

In figure \@ref(fig:prof2) some blocks in the call stack have been highlighted - these are related to the `engine$fontDef` operation occuring. This is a part of the "font sweep", as was described in the introduction to `dvir` in section \@ref(dvirDesc).

In the top left corner of figure \@ref(fig:prof2) we are told the aggregate time spent with `engine$fontDef` is 1830ms. Compared to the total time of this run (a total of about 2700ms), `dvir` is spending a *lot* of time doing these font sweeps.

What was interesting though was that after the actual font sweep the following sweeps for the metric and grid information *also* called `engine$fontDef`. As the point of the font sweep is that it finds all the font information to be used later on the following metric and grid sweeps should not need to "re-sweep" for the fonts.

```{r prof3, fig.cap = "Screenshot of \\texttt{profvis::profvis()} output for the simple example in \\texttt{dvir} version 0.2-1, highlighting \\texttt{engine\\$fontDef}.", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("../Figures/profilingSimpleProfvis_0.2-1_highlight.PNG")
```

The effect of this is very obvious in figure \@ref(fig:prof3) which is the same as figure \@ref(fig:prof1) but highlights the time spent in `engine$fontDef`. The wrappers for the font, metric and grid sweeps are `dviFonts()`, `dviMetric()` and `dvigrid()` respectively (sixth call from the bottom of the stack). Here we can see nearly all of the time spent in the metric and grid sweeps are actually redoing the font sweep.

The change to be made was simply stopping the metric and grid sweeps from doing the font sweep again.

The font sweep looks in the DVI file for op codes 243 to 246. These are the op codes for font definitions and define the name of a font and give it an identifier to reference in the DVI file when it wants to use that font to display a character. 

The following code is taken from the the `dvir` package, showing where the metric and grid sweeps also redid the font sweep. The function `op_font_def` takes the font definition in the DVI file related to that instance of the op code and searches for and records the font information.

```{r metricFont_0.2-1, fig.cap="Metric sweep searching and recording font information in package version 0.2-1, in package file \\texttt{dvir/R/metric.R}", eval=FALSE}
metric_info_243 <- op_font_def
grid_op_243 <- op_font_def
```

The following code shows what the code was changed to in `dvir` version 0.2-2. The function `op_ignore` is an empty function, so when the metric or grid sweeps comes across that op code, they now do nothing.

```{r metricFont_0.2-2, fig.cap="Metric sweep now *not* searching and recording font information in package version 0.2-2, in package file \\texttt{dvir/R/metric.R}", eval=FALSE}
metric_info_243 <- op_ignore
grid_op_243 <- op_ignore
```

Unfortunately these changes alone caused an error when running `grid.latex()`. This is because one task undertaken before the font sweep is to reset or overwrite the global fonts list (which the font sweep then writes to). The metric and grid sweeps were also doing this even though it was only intended for it to be done by the font sweep. This meant after the font sweep was completed it was overwritten by the metric and grid sweeps and so when `dvir` tried to draw the characters there was no font information to refer to.

The resetting of the global fonts list was initiated when the sweeps passed op code 247 in the DVI file, which is the preamble at the start of every DVI file. Setting the metric and grid sweeps to do nothing when they pass the preamble of the DVI file, again by way of `op_ignore`, solved this problem as the global fonts list created by the font sweep is now not overwritten.

```{r metricGlobalFont_0.2-2, fig.cap="Metric sweep now *not* resetting the global fonts list in package version 0.2-2, in package file \\texttt{dvir/R/metric.R}", eval=FALSE}
metric_info_247 <- op_ignore
grid_op_247 <- op_ignore
```

To quantify the impact this has on code speed the time to run the examples 20 times was recorded, after an initial run to compile the package after it was loaded. The average of these 20 runs was then calculated.

For the simple example the time spent in the metric and grid sweeps have decreased by 76% and 83% respectively. The speed of the overall `grid.latex()` call has decreased by 30%.

```{r speedUp1Yee, fig.cap = "The average time spent in the \\texttt{grid.latex()} function, metric sweep and grid sweep before and after these changes, over 20 runs of the complicated example.", echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4}

```

Similarly for the more complicated example in figure \@ref(fig:speedUp1Yee) the metric and grid sweeps have decreased by 83% and 89% respectively, with `grid.latex()` overall taking 47% less time.
