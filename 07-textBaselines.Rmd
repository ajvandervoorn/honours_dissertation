# Text baselines

- Do all this without examples first maybe, as that will be some fiddly work?

- Demonstrate problem (with example using grid.text), especially try multi line text maybe?

- Describe algorithms for determining baselines one by one. In dviMoves, describe then the issues with choosing which one, and the potential algorithms for that

- Describe function I made to calculate all baselines using these methods

- Show result of all this (in LaTeX)

<!---
Do I need to include my baseline algorithms function? as appendix?

Should I take out the TikZ bit of the algorithms function? As it's not needed and I don't want to have to explain it.
